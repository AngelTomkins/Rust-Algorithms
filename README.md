# Rust-Algorithms
A collection of algorithms written in Rust. Each example may have multiple different implementations due to more or less efficient code.

## Examples

## Pi

| Algorithm | Example Id | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Leibniz | leibniz_pi | One of the most well known formulas for calculating pi, though it is very slow. ([More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)) |
| Machin | machin_pi | A much faster formula for calculating pi which takes advantage of fast estimations of arctan ([More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin-like_formula)) |
