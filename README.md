# Rust-Algorithms
A collection of algorithms written in Rust. Each example may have multiple different implementations due to more or less efficient code.

## Examples

## Pi

| Algorithm | Example Id | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Leibniz | leibniz_pi | One of the most well known formulas for calculating pi, though it is very slow. |
| Machin | machin_pi | A much faster formula for calculating pi which takes advantage of fast estimations of arctan |
